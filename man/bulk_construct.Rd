\title{Construct artificial bulk tissue expression from single cell data}
\usage{
bulk_construct(sce, clusters, samples, select.ct = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment, single cell dataset}

\item{clusters}{character, the colData used as clusters}

\item{samples}{character, the colData used as samples}

\item{select.ct}{vector of cell types included, default as \code{NULL}. If \code{NULL}, include all cell types in \code{x}.
Otherwise, only cells of selected cell types will be used for construction.}
}
\value{
Matrix of expression of constructed bulk tissue, matrix of cell number in each cluster by sample
}
\description{
Artificial bulk tissue expression is generated by adding gene expressions of all cells from
same subjects.
